# webdev2-eindOpdracht
### designed and developed by Hannes De Baere

This is a project where people can share their ideas and projects and ask for fundings to the public.
People can watch projects, and if they like them they can make a pledge.

Some implementations:
-mailings (by mailgun)
-payment (by stripe)
